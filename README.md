# Heineken Vending Machine Reader Chrome Extensions

## Please, read it before.

This is part of a prototype I had done a couple of years ago and, I spent a long time looking for solutions like that.

This is a small library that allows to Chrome extension to connect and interact with a fingertip sensor. At all, this creates a binary socket and allows Chrome to communicate with some connected fingertip sensor.

Look, probably it will not work with any fingertip sensor, because every manufacturer has own proper interface.

Maybe it helps you to implement your own binary socket interface to interact with external hardware in Chrome extensions ðŸ™‚
